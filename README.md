# WifiView
A simple tool to manage your WiFi networks and profiles. This is basically a GUI that that wrapps the _Managed WiFi API_ source that I found on the net (link in credits) with a modification of an user of stackoverflow.

## Requisites
- .NET Framework 2.0
- Tested under Windows 10 (v. 1809), should work from windows 7
- Developed in Visual Studio 2019, but shouldcompile in almost any visual studio 

## Notes
I converted the WiFi profiles from XML to C# thanks to this page: http://xmltocsharp.azurewebsites.net/
